"With the increased budget I have added more number of web servers, app servers for redundecy as well as better DB servers with more provisioned IOPS and SSD space. I also added increased CloudFront distribution in another nearby region as well as web, app and DB stack for redundancy across regions. Also CloudFront distrubution is configured for more data with more outbound capacity.",,,,,,,,
